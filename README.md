# jmd2notebook
A simple julia markdown to ipython notebook converter. All operations are invertible so the transformation of these two file type should not have significant data loss. However, due to the difference mathjax and julia interpret markdowns, the displayed markdown would be somewhat different. 
## Usage
python script.py -i InputFile -o OutputFile
